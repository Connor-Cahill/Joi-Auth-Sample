# Auth with JOI Validation Sample API 
This is a starter template for creating modular and secure RESTful APIs. This repo already has user authentication and authorization setup as well as user schema validation using Joi. 

## Motivation
My motivation for creating this project was to have an easy API template I could fork and be able to quickly create new APIs.
